# SIFT-Licence-Plate-detector
License Plate recognition


Scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) describing local features is a robust and reliable method for many pattern recognition purposes 
and can be applied to a wide range of problems  in  which local features are critical and helpful, like recognizing characters of license car plate.

This projects includes the necessary Dataset of about 400 image of cars, and the code file.
to test different cropped Licence Plates images just change the corresponding path in the code.
